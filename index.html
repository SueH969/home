		The planet earth is home to a variety of species and unique little creatures. However, when we think about superpowers, all we seem to think about are the superheroes from the movies. Here are 10 of the most incredible animals with the most bizarre and unique features. See if after reading this article, do you still think that superheroes are that cool. (Read from <a href = "#bottom">bottom</a> to top)

		<h3>1. Immortal Jellyfish</h3>

		<p class = "before-heading">
		Commonly known as the immortal jellyfish, the Turritopsis dohrnii is known for its ability to outlast death and receive a death pass from Hades, ruler of the underworld. Unless it gets consumed or if a disease strikes, it theoretically can live forever as it has the natural ability to retract and shrink to its original state once it hits its adult form to then start its life all over again. Though you might be curious how old the oldest of them all is, unfortunately, there is no exact answer to this. No immortal jellyfish has been observed in a laboratory for an extended duration of time. There also is no way to determine the age of one either. The thing is, we humans can only live for that long.

		<h3>2. Axolotl</h3>
		<img class  = "content-images" src = "axolotl.jpg" alt = "Image of an Axolotl on a Log">
		<p class = "before-heading">
		Otherwise referred to as the Mexican Walking Fish (though it is not a fish), the Axolotl, like all salamanders, has the ability to completely regenerate an entire limb when it somehow goes missing. Asides from that, axolotls can also reconstruct various other body parts, including their tail, eyes, segments of their heart and brain, and other organs. Though it is hard to imagine how one loses its brain, the important thing is that it can regenerate it when needed. This is why, as opposed to the normal predation process, parasites and infections are the more common causes of death for axolotls.

		<h3>3. Lyrebird</h3>
		<img class  = "content-images" src = "lyrebird.jpg" alt = "Image of a Lyrebird Perched on a Branch">
		<p class = "before-heading">
		Capable of mimicking almost any sound, the lyrebird is known for its master imitating abilities. Some of you might wonder though, don&rsquo;t parrots do the same? Not quite, because not only can they mimic the sound of 20 other bird species, but additionally, man-made sounds like chain saws, car alarms, engines, crying babies, ringtones, laser guns, and the list goes on. Thinking back to the time you thought parrots were cool. How does it even make sense that you probably never heard of the lyrebird before, but you’ve seen a parrot in the zoo?
		</p>
		<h3>4. Dolphin</h3>
		<img class  = "content-images" src = "dolphin.jpg" alt = "Image of a Dolphin in the Pool">
		<p class = "before-heading">
		Thought about whether you&rsquo;d survive if you somehow ended up in the animal world? Where danger creeps by every second of your life? Well, for the dolphins, this is the reality they face. So, what do they do? As it turns out, they’ve developed the habit of sleeping with one eye open, simultaneously, only shutting down half of their brain activity while they sleep. So that even while regaining energy from a good night’s sleep, they can observe their surroundings and watch for any predators that might want to sneak up on them. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine how one can control the activity of its brain as if there was a control center that just turns the switches.
		</p>
		<h3>5. Ostrich</h3>
		<img class  = "content-images" src = "ostrich.jpg" alt = "Image of a Standing Ostrich">
		<p class = "before-heading">
		Slightly different from the other animals mentioned on this list, the ostrich has two unique features. First off, the size of its brain. If you’ve ever seen an ostrich in the zoo, you know how small its head is. With a huge eye and bill like that, the size of its brain often comes up as an interesting topic. Ever ate a walnut before? Well, that’s how big its brain is, literally, the size of a walnut. As for their eyes, being one of the largest amongst any bird in the world is bigger than its brain and five times the size of a human eye. Though this would mean that ostriches aren’t particularly intelligent, their vision, on the other hand, can see as far as 3.5km.
		</p>
		<h3>6. Hippo</h3>
		<img class  = "content-images" src = "hippo.jpg" alt = "Image of a Hippo and its Calf">
		<p class = "before-heading">
		Hippopotamuses save tons of money when it comes to sun-bathing as they have the ability to produce natural sunscreen. Though they do spend a lot of time submerged in the water, they do come out once in a while. Hence, during that time, they need to keep themselves cool. Which is where their sunscreen comes into play. Naturally, they can produce a red, sweat resembling substance that is actually an oily fluid that helps to keep their body cool and moist. The truth is, the African environment that they habit is harsh, and as a result, they’ve adapted to this situation by developing a self-cooling method.
		</p>
		<h3>7. Spiny Mouse</h3>
		<img class  = "content-images" src = "spiny_mouse.jpg" alt = "Image of a Spiny Mouse on a Tree Root">
		<p class = "before-heading">
		Ever seen a clip in the movies where one person is trying to get a hold of another? And they take off their jacket or outer clothing to escape their grip? Well, that’s the idea of the superpower the Spiny Mouse holds. Not only can they discard chunks of their skin to escape from a predator&rsquo;s clutches, as if it were a reptile, shedding its skin. Additionally, they are capable of re-growing the skin, cartilage, fur, and even their sweat glands once they&rsquo;re removed. Mice being near the bottom of the food chain, clearly, don’t just wait to end up as someone’s feast.
		</p>
		<h3>8. Electric Eel</h3>
		<img class  = "content-images" src = "electric_eel.jpg" alt = "Image of an Electric Eel Underwater">
		<p class = "before-heading">
		As stated in its name, electric eels produce electricity. Up to 600 volts of electricity, enough to paralyze a typical human. The electric shock they produce is generated from their three special organs, including the main organ, the Hunter’s organ, and the Sach’s organ. This capability is very important for them as this is their method of hunting prey, and at the same time, their way of defending themselves from predators. One of the most intriguing things, however, is that they’ve been using electricity way before humans invented it in the 1700s. 
		</p>
		<h3>9. Clownfish</h3>
		<img class  = "content-images" src = "clownfish.jpg" alt = "Image of a Sad Looking Clownfish">
		<p class = "before-heading">
		Clownfish, along with many other fish species, are known to be able to switch sex, including reproductive functions. Clownfish all begin life as a male. The social structure of a school of clownfish is always built with a female at the top. This is why, when she dies, the most dominant male will change sex into a female and take her place. Nevertheless, once they transitioned into a female, they can’t go back to being male. In other words, this change is irreversible. Furthermore, because the female is the one able to give birth, it would be that they were born not knowing if they would end up being the mom or the dad.

		<h3 id = "bottom">10. Flamingo</h3>
		<img class  = "content-images" src = "flamingo.jpg" alt = "Image of 2 Flamingos in the Winter">
		<p>
		A majority would agree that what makes a flamingo so special is its distinctive bright pink colour. Did you know though? They are technically grey? Unlike some animals that are born a certain colour but naturally change into another, like pandas, that porn pink but then grow into black and white. Flamingos, contrastingly, “eat” into their colour. The truth is, the colour of their feathers grows to be pink because of a natural pink dye that they obtain from their diet that comprises of brine shrimp and blue-green algae. Think about it this way. If one day, for some reason, they’ve adapted to a new diet. What colour would their feathers be?
